# R Workshop? Really? Well sort of... more to come in the future!
Workshop files for public use: Created in July - September 2020 for Univ. of WA Cultivate Learning @ College of Education - Innovation Lab Project
RMD files created on macOS Catalina ver. 10.15.5 | R Studio ver. 1.3.959 -> 1.4.1

## Background
As for my professional life, I'm serving within a spectrum of data transformation expert to the laziest person to work on anything... so I decided to utilize what I've seen, read, and learned from my previous experiences (since, well you know, working in an early childhood sector, being data/research scientist/professor is considered a rare kind and you sometimes have to do your work A to Z or as I call in Korean 가(Ga) to 하(Ha) hahaha.... sigh sorry, I lost you.

Below topics are covered during R workshop sessions with Cultivate Learning R enthusiasts.

* Intro to R: R Studio & R Markdown
* Data Frame & Data Reshape: Extract variables you need, rename variable names, filter necessary value on the cell(s), and/or, save it as a new data frame then as a csv file.
* Data Reshape 2: How to change data shape from wide to long data? This is for those who use Tableau on a regular basis and those who would like to utilize replicable data practices in R for any secondary data analysis. 
* Review of R: Refresher session. For those who are interested in conducting a qualitative analysis, this workshop articulates how I clean and transform the data set.

## Folder Structure
In each folder, you'll find one of the following folders: 

* Document: Contains slides or other resource documentation
* Source: R codes including RMD file(s) and sometimes HTML & md files
* Data: Data transformation folder will have this folder which contains a data set available from a public data source @ data.wa.gov.

What else should I consider for future workshop topics? Please pull requests or you can also reach out to me via mhwangbo11@gmail.com.
