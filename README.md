## Background
As for my professional life, I'm serving within a spectrum of data transformation expert to the laziest person to work on anything... so I decided to utilize what I've seen, read, and learned from my previous experiences. Below topics are covered during R workshop sessions with Cultivate Learning R enthusiasts.

* Intro to R: R Studio & R Markdown
* Data Frame & Data Reshape: Extract variables you need, rename variable names, filter necessary value on the cell(s), and/or, save it as a new data frame then as a csv file.
* Data Reshape 2: How to change data shape from wide to long data? This is for those who use Tableau on a regular basis and those who would like to utilize replicable practices in R. 

What else should I consider for future workshop topics? Please pull requests or you can also reach out to me via foreverm@uw.edu.

Thanks for reading this!
